              Recipedia Marketplace will be a fully featured metaverse
              marketplace that connects at home chefs with great recipes in an
              ad-free browsing experience. As the project matures, add to cart
              functionality, cooking tutorials and other brand building tools
              will be integrated. The marketplace will become a self-sustaining
              ecosystem where chefs can move up the search results based on
              performance & assets held.
